    "# Modules and Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a module is a single file containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. It can also include runnable code. Modules help in organizing code into manageable sections and promote code reuse. A package, on the other hand, is a collection of related modules bundled together within a directory. Each package contains a special `__init__.py` file, which indicates to Python that the directory should be treated as a package. Packages allow for a hierarchical structuring of the module namespace, making it easier to manage large codebases by logically grouping related modules together."
